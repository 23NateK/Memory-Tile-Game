Memory Game – Flipping Tiles

Memory Game is a mind game where you have to remember the position of tiles placed earlier and re-assign them within the stipulated time. This game is implemented to play with your mind and bring the best.

Abstract: This Java-based gaming application is built using Swing. This game’s intention is to test our memory, here, we see an even number of tiles in which each number has a pair. All the tiles are kept facing downwards, all the tiles have to be flipped one by one, and when two tiles get matched they are removed from the tile. When there’s no match, the tiles are kept back in position. 

<b>Technologies Required</b>: Java, Java Swing, Java OOPS, and ArrayLists in Java.
